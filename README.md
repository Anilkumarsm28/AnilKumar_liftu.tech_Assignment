This repository contains a comprehensive Automation Testing Framework designed for web applications using Java and Selenium WebDriver. The framework is built to be highly modular, scalable, and maintainable. It incorporates advanced features such as detailed reporting with Extent Reports and TestNG integration for efficient test execution and management.
________________________________________
Key Features
1.	Web Automation with Java and Selenium:
o	Automates various browser interactions and validations using Selenium WebDriver.
o	Supports multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) for cross-browser testing.
2.	TestNG Integration:
o	Enables grouping, parallel execution, and prioritization of test cases.
o	Allows easy configuration of test suites via testng.xml.
3.	Detailed Reporting:
o	Uses Extent Reports for enhanced, visually appealing reports.
o	Reports include detailed logs, screenshots of failed tests, and test execution summaries.
4.	Listener Support:
o	Custom listeners handle test lifecycle events (e.g., logging test results, capturing screenshots on failure).
5.	Data-Driven Testing:
o	Extendable for testing with dynamic data using external files (e.g., Excel, CSV).
6.	Maintainable Design:
o	Implements the Page Object Model (POM) for reusability and separation of concerns.
o	Modular structure for easy addition of new test cases and features.
7.	Parallel Execution:
o	Configured for parallel test execution, optimizing test run times.

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Anilkumarsm28/AnilKumar_liftu.tech_Assignment.git
cd AnilKumar_liftu.tech_Assignment
2. Install Dependencies
Run the following Maven command to install all required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
3. Configure testng.xml
•	Modify the testng.xml file to customize test groups, parallel execution settings, and other configurations.
4. Run Tests

Key Tools and Technologies
•	Programming Language: Java
•	Automation Framework: Selenium WebDriver
•	Test Management: TestNG
•	Reporting: Extent Reports
•	Build Tool: Maven
________________________________________
Extent Reports
•	Location: Reports are generated in the reports directory.
•	Features:
o	Detailed logs of each test step.
o	Screenshots attached for failed test cases.
o	Summary of passed, failed, and skipped tests.
________________________________________
Custom Features
1.	Listener Implementation:
o	Captures test events (e.g., start, skip, fail).
o	Automatically captures screenshots for failed tests.
2.	Page Object Model:
o	Abstracts test logic and page interactions.
o	Enhances code reusability and readability.
3.	Test Data Management:
o	Extendable to handle data-driven scenarios using external sources.
4.	Parallel Execution:
o	Configured to run tests in parallel using testng.xml.
________________________________________
Sample Extent Report
After running the test suite, a sample Extent Report will look like this:
•	Overview: Provides a high-level summary of test execution.
•	Details: Logs of individual test cases with pass/fail status.
•	Screenshots: Captures the browser state for failed test cases.
________________________________________
Future Enhancements
1.	Continuous Integration (CI):
o	Integration with CI tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated builds and test execution.
2.	Cross-Browser Testing:
o	Extending compatibility with more browsers and operating systems using Selenium Grid.
3.	Advanced Test Data Management:
o	Incorporating dynamic test data from databases or external APIs.
